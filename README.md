Robotics final project
# How to use:
# Robot set up
Step 1: Make sure the robotic arm and the gaming controller are attached to an immobile surface.<br />
Step 2: Position the robotic arm so that the tip of the arm rests on the analog stick of the gaming controller.<br />
Step 3: Fix the tip of the robotic arm to the analog stick, so that the tip does not slip away from the analog stick during heavy movement.<br />
Duct tape was used in our setup to attach the arm and the controller to a surface and to fix the tip of the robotic arm to the analog stick.<br />
<br />
The setup should be similar to the setup seen in the following image:
